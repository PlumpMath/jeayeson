    JeayeSON
/***************/

A very sane (highly templated) C++ JSON library

/***************/
    Building
/***************/

In the project directory, run:

  $ ./build.sh
  
You're welcome to take a look at the build script before you run it; there's
very little going on other than a cmake build out of the project directory 
(for sanitary purposes).

Once built, you can run the test(s) by executing the produced binary:

  $ ./bin/jeayeson
  
The test(s) should show (in main.cpp) how to use JeayeSON. Enjoy!

#define JEAYESON_STDMAP 1
  Use std::map instead of boost::unordered_map (decrease in performance on large data sets)

A very sane (highly templated) C++ JSON library

In the project directory, run:

  $ ./build.sh
  
You're welcome to take a look at the build script before you run it; there's
very little going on other than a cmake build out of the project directory 
(for sanitary purposes).

Once built, you can run the test(s) by executing the produced binary:

  $ ./bin/jeayeson
  
The test(s) should show how to use JeayeSON (it's very simple). Enjoy!
